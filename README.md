# Sorting-Implementation
This is my implementation for Quicksort and Mergesort algorithm using Java.
To do Quicksort or Mergesort an int array, simply import the class and call the method quickSort or mergeSort and pass in the array.
The function will also print out the comparisson and swaps required to complete the sort.
